# Airdrop List Verifier

The `Airdrop List Verifier` is a utility that simplifies the process of organizing airdrops for Hedera tokens. Users can input a Token ID and a list of account IDs to which they wish to airdrop tokens. The application generates a list of addresses either associated with the token or having available auto-association slots, ensuring efficient and targeted airdrops.

## Usage

Get started by installing dependencies and running the project:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Input the Token ID and account IDs list in the format required by the application to build your list of eligible recipients.
